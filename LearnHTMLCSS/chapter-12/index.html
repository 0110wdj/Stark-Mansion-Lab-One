    <h2>A Heart wrapped in fur</h2>
    <p class="intro">The <a class="breed" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wikiBriard"> briard</a>, or berger de brie,
        is a large breed of dog traditionally used as a herder and guardian of sheep.</p>
    <h3>Breed History</h3>
    <p>The Surrogate's Courthouse is a historic building at the northwest corner of Chambers and Centre Streets in New
        York City. A seven-story, steel-framed structure in the Beaux Arts style, with a granite facade and elaborate
        marble interiors, it was completed in 1907. John Rochester Thomas created the original plans while Arthur J.
        Horgan and Vincent J. Slattery oversaw the building's completion. The exterior is decorated with fifty-four
        sculptures by Philip Martiny and Henry Kirke Bush-Brown, as well as three-story Corinthian-style colonnades on
        Chambers and Reade Streets. The building's basement houses the New York City Municipal Archives. The fifth floor
        contains the surrogate's court for New York County, which handles probate and estate proceedings for the New
        York State Unified Court System. The Surrogate's Courthouse is listed on the National Register of Historic
        Places as a National Historic Landmark, and its facade and interior are both New York City designated landmarks.
